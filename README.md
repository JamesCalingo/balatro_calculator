## Balatro

Balatro is a game based on poker. Without getting TOO DEEP into it, you make poker hands which are then scored based on how they rank as in regular poker.

A single "game" of Balatro (known as a run) is broken into levels known as "antes", each of which consists of three rounds known as "blinds". To advance, you have to clear each blind by scoring enough points based on the hands you play (you can play multiple hands per round).

## Ante 1 Small Blind

Your goal in this ante is to score 300 chips. However, to maximize the amount of money you can get from this blind, it's STRONGLY recommended to only play one hand (i.e. one shot).

Anything three of a kind or below will NOT clear this blind, while anything four of a kind or above will clear BEFORE calculating chips, so they're not involved in this. Additionally, straights are not here as the "math" on those is easy (it needs to be at least Queen high in order to clear). Therefore, we're left with just flushes and full houses.
